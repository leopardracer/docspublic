# Featured Creators

Congratulations on being featured!

First, join Stargaze Discord if you haven’t yet, which is where all communication will happen: [discord.gg/stargaze](http://discord.gg/stargaze)



As a reminder, you can launch on your own at anytime (non-featured). Stargaze has a permissionless Launchpad, as long as it follow our ToS.



**Advantages of being featured:**

✮ Visibility on Launchpad for 1 week&#x20;

✮ Social media marketing and launch support&#x20;

✮ Featured collections earned almost 10x revenue vs. non-featured&#x20;

✮ Higher mint percent (\~99%)



Here are some rules/guidelines for your launch, if you are Featured.

* Start testnet as soon as possible. Do not deploy on mainnet before we give the ok.
* 2 or 3 weeks before your launch, we will create a thread on Featured creators for the projects launching on that week. Keep all communications on that thread; do not DM - it is easier for other team members to help if needed.
* We will request a few things from your end, so we can make the announcements (short description, NFT images, Names, etc). After you launch, in a week or so, you will be requested to make a thread on Twitter using #StargazeStories. The thread will have more details on those.
* There's a Twitter Spaces (obligatory to participate) on Thursday, one day before you launch, at 19 UTC.



**Featured Specs:**

* The public mint start time must be on Friday, 19 UTC.
* Cover image min. size is 1000x1000; (please keep this one square if possible, so our launchpad looks uniform)
* NFT minimum size is 1000x1000.
* Royalties for featured is max 7%
* WL max allocation is 50% from available number after airdrops. (So if your collection is 1k NFTs, but you airdrop 100, it's 50% of 900). It counts the max mints per wallet, not just number of wallets.
* If you want to over allocate the WL (go over the 50% limit), you may use WL Flex contract. It costs 20k STARS to deploy.
* Open Edition is unable to have a WL.
* We will NOT feature any porn/NSFW/extreme gore/copy\&paste projects, as well as anything detrimental to Stargaze image.
* No copyrighted content is allowed.
* If your project has already launched, it cannot be featured.
* Featured projects have a spotlight on front page and launchpad for 1 week.
* Cooldown: to avoid having the same artist over and over every week, we have a 6 week cooldown for Team Picks/Community Vote.



**Auction Winners for Featured Spots:**

* All rules above must be followed.
* Launch Date on the NFT is the date of your public launch. This will not be changed.
* If you won an auction, submit your project before the expiration date on Stargaze Discord.
* If you don’t submit on time or do not respect deadlines, there will be no refunds. Please be sure you are able to work on schedule.
