# Promote and build demand for your NFT project

**CREATING A COLLECTION**

* **Your interest in the theme**

What are you passionate about? What do you have interest in/enjoy?

* **Specific Audience**

Does that cater to a specific group/audience that you can connect to?

* **Uniqueness**

Does it stand out from all other projects, in any way?

* **Your personal strengths**

What are you good at? coding/art/memes/marketing/communication? Try to use that to your advantage in the project.



**BUILDING A COMMUNITY**

* **Time/effort**

Consider the time and effort it will take to build a community or reach out to people. Being a creator is a very time consuming activity, it will demand a lot from you.

* **Discord/twitter - social media**

Use social media to reach out, usually giveaways on twitter and create your own channel on discord to be in touch with your community closely. **Make sure to tag @stargazezone on Twitter so we see your posts.**

* **Connect with people with similar interests**

Bring people in, stay active on the channel, show people you are committed to the project. Answer questions in a timely manner, show previews constantly on what you are working on.

* **Make strong partnerships with other projects**

Make collabs with other projects, in the form of giveaways or a homage to them on your own collection (with their permission). Collab NFTs tend to generate more interest than regular ones.



**BUILDING MOMENTUM TO LAUNCH**

* **Promotion via social media**

Make people know about your project, spread the word around. Creating “hype” depends on your following, and members that also help to promote because they enjoy/believe in your project.

* **Use videos / memes / images**

Use relatable media to get people engaged, well done videos and memes are a powerful tool to get it done. Create memorable and funny assets that will stick around.

* **Be active outside your own channel**

Don’t seclude yourself on your own channel, be active on Stargaze discord/telegram for example so people will “know” you before you launch. Familiarize yourself with other creators and communities outside your own.

* **Create demand**

Generating demand through making your NFT “desirable”, does it have great art? Unique concept? Current utility? Strong community to thrive?

* **Consider supply and price**

Carefully think about how the supply numbers combined with price will make it mint out; Having a stale collection will be hurtful in the overall vision people have of your project. Ideally, you will have fewer NFTs available than the demand for it. Check similar projects and see how they are doing on their sales. Gauging the worth of your project is important to have a successful launch.
