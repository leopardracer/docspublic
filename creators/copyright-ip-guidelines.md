## **Copyright**

**Understanding Copyright** \
In the simplest terms, copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work (like a book, movie, picture, song or website) the right to say how other people can use it. With copyright, a work can only be used with the owner's permission. If you did not create the work or if the owner has not given you permission to use it, using the work would be infringing upon the copyright. \
\
**Respect Intellectual Property** \
Intellectual property includes anything from a particular logo, character, book, movie, or music. If the item, character, or work is recognizable, there's a good chance it is protected by copyright. When creating your NFTs, please ensure your work is not infringing on any copyrighted materials. \
\
**Why Itâ€™s Important** \
Infringing copyright is against the policy of the hosting provider for stargaze.zone. Violations could result in legal action taken against the creator by the original copyright holder, which may result in fines or other legal penalties. \
\
If you want to use copyrighted material, please have written and express consent to use the copyrighted material by the original owner.

### Suggestions

If you want to create an NFT inspired by a copyrighted work, consider these alternatives: \
\
**Create Original Work:** There's no better way to avoid copyright issues than by creating 100% original work. This ensures that your work is unique and not in violation of any copyright laws. \
\
**Use Copyright-Free Material:** There are many resources online where you can find copyright-free materials to use as inspiration or elements in your NFTs. These include Creative Commons, Open Source, and Public Domain materials. Be sure to verify that the materials are indeed copyright-free before using them. \
\
**Get Permission:** If you want to use copyrighted material, the safest approach is to get explicit, written permission from the copyright owner. This can sometimes be a lengthy process, and there may be fees involved, but it is the only sure way to protect yourself from copyright infringement claims. \
\
**Fair Use Doctrine:** In some cases, copyrighted material can be used under the "Fair Use" doctrine. However, fair use is a complex legal doctrine and is determined on a case-by-case basis. If you believe your use of copyrighted material falls under this category, consult with a legal expert before proceeding.

\
In conclusion, we highly encourage all creators to respect the rights of other artists and creators, just as you would want your rights respected. As an artist, it's crucial to understand these guidelines to avoid potential legal disputes or having your work taken down. \

Stargaze does not/will not provide legal advice on what is permitted/what is not. Launching on Stargaze (chain) is permissionless, but the website is subject to rules and laws through the hosting provider.
