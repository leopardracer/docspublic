# What is Stargaze?

## The NFT Chain with Real Yield

Stargaze is a Cosmos app chain designed to **empower creators, traders, and developers**. It enforces royalties onchain for both creators and developers, and offers real yield to stakers. Stargaze offers a suite of NFT-Fi apps that compose well with each other, from NFT minting and trading, to more advanced financial apps.

As an app chain, Stargaze is secured by a validator set consisting of 140 nodes. This network runs proof-of-stake consensus and is secured and governed by STARS. Delegators stake STARS to validators and earn staking rewards.&#x20;

### Chain-enforced Royalties

A big differentiating factor Stargaze has compared to other NFT platforms is that royalties are enforced at the chain level. Since Stargaze is permissioned, a governance vote would have to pass to bypass royalties. Therefore, marketplaces on Stargaze all enforce royalties â€” an impossibility on other chains and L2s.
