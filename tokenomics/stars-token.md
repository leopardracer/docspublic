### Total Supply

The STARS token is the native cryptocurrency of the Stargaze chain. Initially, there were 4 billion STARS tokens, but this number was reduced to 3,000,000,000 (3 billion) following a governance vote on May 27, 2023 ([Proposal 165](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/165)).

As of June 17, 2024, 2.5 billion STARS tokens are in circulation, with the remaining tokens yet to be issued.

### Token release schedule

The issuance of STARS tokens is structured to decrease gradually over time, following a model similar to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin's halving events, STARS reduces its token issuance by one-third annually. Each year, the number of new tokens created is reduced to two-thirds of the current issuance until STARS reaches a asymptotic maximum supply of 3 billion.
