# Fair Burn

### Burning stars

All fees collected from the Stargaze marketplace and launchpad are subject to the Fair Burn mechanism. This mechanic allocates 50% of the fees to be burned, effectively reducing the total supply of STARS tokens. The remaining 50% is distributed to STARS stakers as rewards.

For example, when you sell an NFT, a 2% Fair Burn fee is applied.
