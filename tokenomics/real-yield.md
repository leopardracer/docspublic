# Real Yield

### How to yield

The token mechanics of STARS include Real Yield for stakers. Real Yield offers a higher rate of return in STARS for staking than the chain-level inflation. This yield is a combination of the staking yield and the yield provided by the Fair Burn mechanism of the protocol.

As a STARS staker, you earn yield from trading and minting activities, as well as from securing the network.
