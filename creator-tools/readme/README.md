# Launching an NFT project

## Overview

This tutorial will walk you through getting all your assets and metadata ready for an NFT, and show you how to deploy them as a smart contract on Stargaze.

This tutorial assumes you have some familiarity with coding and using the command line. We will be using the following dependencies:

* [node](https://nodejs.dev)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [CosmWasmJS](https://github.com/CosmWasm/CosmWasmJS)
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
  * [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/)
  * [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not familiar with coding and the command line or simply looking for an easier way to publish your collection, check out the [stargaze-studio](../../creator-tools/stargaze-studio/ "mention") guide.
