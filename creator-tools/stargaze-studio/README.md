## Overview

Stargaze Studio is a dApp to create and manage NFT collections on Stargaze by providing smart contract front ends. It is built to provide useful smart contract interfaces that help you build and deploy your own NFT collections without writing a single line of code.

Using the Stargaze Studio menu on the left you can

* Create NFT collections with customized settings
* See your collections and interact with them
* Execute messages on a collection
* Query data from a collection

In addition to these features, Stargaze Studio provides a smart contract dashboard where users can **instantiate**, **query**, and **execute** the main NFT smart contracts such as **minter**, **SG721**, and **whitelist** contracts.

There is **no coding knowledge required** to follow the tutorials as Stargaze Studio provides the necessary interface for each action. Additionally, a tutorial video for each step will be given at the end of the page.
