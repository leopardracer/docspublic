# Whitelist and Royalty Options

### Whitelist

1/1 Collections have no minting phase and thus no whitelist functionality.

### Royalty

Royalties are payments that are transferred to an address every time an NFT from that collection is sold in the marketplace.

You only need to set two parameters:

* **A payment address** that will receive the funds
* **The** **share percentage** you want from each sale

If you are done with the configurations, press the **Create Collection** button and sign the pop-up transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike the previous section, you will receive **two different transactions** to sign. The first one is to instantiate the whitelist contract and the second one is to publish the collection.
{% endhint %}

An info box will appear at the top of the page when the transactions are confirmed.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to save all the printed information as you'll need the addresses to interact with the collection. Visit the [interact-with-a-collection](../../interact-with-a-collection/ "mention") page to learn about the interactions you can have with the collection after the launch.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! You have successfully learned how to create a collection with whitelist and royalty configurations.
{% endhint %}
