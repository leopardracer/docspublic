The 1/1 Collection minter creates a collection starting with a single token where more tokens can be added to the collection over time. Common uses for the 1/1 collection include setting up a series of commissioned pieces, an "honorary" collection for community members, or other projects that involve ongoing creations and releases within a series.

**Important:** There is no minting phase in 1/1 Collections - tokens are created directly within the creator's wallet where they can be transferred, auctioned, or sold directly on the secondary market.\
\
To begin creating a collection, ensure that the following steps have been taken:\
\
1\) You are connected to testnet at [studio.publicawesome.dev](https://studio.publicawesome.dev)\
2\) Your wallet is connected on the top left of the screen ([Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) or Leap wallets are recommended)\
3\) You have testnet tokens in your address. Testnet tokens can be requested in the #faucet channel of the [Stargaze Discord. ](https://discord.gg/stargaze)
