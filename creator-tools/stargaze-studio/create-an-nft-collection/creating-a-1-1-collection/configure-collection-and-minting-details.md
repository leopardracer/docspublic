# Configure Collection Details: 1/1 Collection

### Collection Details

#### Minting Details

_There is no minting phase for 1/1 collections._

Tokens will be minted directly into the creator's wallet to be transferred, auctioned, or sold directly on the secondary market.

#### Collection Details

Now that the assets and metadata are ready, you need to decide on the collection details. These are the essential information related to your collection, we suggest you double-check them as some of them are not changeable after the collection is published.

The following information is needed:

#### Collection Details

* **Name:** The title of your collection
* **Description:** The detailed explanation of your collection
* **Symbol:** A symbol for your collection.
* **Cover Image:** The cover image that will be shown on the collection page. GIFs are supported.
* **External Link (optional):** A link you can provide on your collection page such as a webpage.

After completing collection details, the page should look something like this:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now that the essential details are filled, the collection is ready to be published. However, if you want to set a royalty percentage, proceed to the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

If you don't want to set any whitelist or royalty, press the **Create Collection** button and sign the pop-up transaction. An info box will appear at the top of the page when the transaction is confirmed.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to save all the printed information as you'll need the addresses to interact with the collection. Visit the [interact-with-a-collection](../../interact-with-a-collection/ "mention") page to learn about the interactions you can have with the collection after the launch.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! You have successfully learned how to create and publish an NFT collection.

It may take a little time until your collection appears on Stargaze.
