A Standard Collection is a collection of up to 10,000 unique NFTs that utilizes the Stargaze randomized minter. This is the most common collection type for things like PFP collections.

To begin creating a collection, ensure that the following steps have been taken:\
\
1\) You are connected to testnet at [studio.publicawesome.dev](https://studio.publicawesome.dev)\
2\) Your wallet is connected on the top left of the screen\
3\) You have testnet tokens in your address. Testnet tokens can be requested in the #faucet channel of the [Stargaze Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze).
