# Interact with a Collection

### Interacting with your Collection

When a collection is published using Stargaze Studio, it can be found on [my collections](https://studio.stargaze.zone/collections/myCollections/) page.

The next step after publishing your collection is to interact with it. You can click on the settings icon to interact with the collection or the rocket icon to see your collection's launchpad page.

If your collection does not appear on my collections page or you want to interact with a collection published by someone else, you can do by providing the SG721 and Minter contract addresses.

You can do the following actions:

* Execute messages
* Query data

To learn more about what you can query and execute, head to their respective pages.
