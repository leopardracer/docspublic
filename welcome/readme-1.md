# Coming from MANTRA?

{% hint style="success" %}

2. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://www.stargaze.zone) and connect [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/)
3. Click Bridge, select IBC Swap, OM on MANTRA -> OM on [Stargaze](https://www.stargaze.zone/)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

There are several options to quickly accomplish this.
