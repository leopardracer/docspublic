  NFTs.

# Coming from Solana?

{% hint style="success" %}
**TLDR**

1. Get [keplr.app](https://www.keplr.app/)
2. Go to [https://app.osmosis.zone/assets](https://t.co/dVQFBSXyt6), deposit SOL
3. Swap SOL -> STARS
{% endhint %}

The [Stargaze website](https://www.stargaze.zone) currently doesn't support Solana wallets. Therefore, we recommend starting with a Cosmos ecosystem native wallet.

1. Download [keplr.app](https://www.keplr.app/).
2. Create a new account or import a seed phrase.

You're now ready to fund your wallet and begin your Stargaze journey.
