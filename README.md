  How to onboard to Stargaze from Ethereum and start trading Bad Kids and other
  NFTs.
---

# Coming from Ethereum?

{% hint style="success" %}
**TLDR**

1. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://www.stargaze.zone) and connect Metamask&#x20;
2. Click Swap ETH -> STARS&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The [Stargaze website](https://www.stargaze.zone) supports Metamask via [Snaps](https://snaps.metamask.io/). Snaps enables Metamask to communicate with non-EVM chains like Stargaze. So you don't need to download another wallet.

1. Click "Connect Wallet" and select Metamask.
2. A stars address will generated and displayed in the wallet.

That's it!

### Fund Wallet with STARS

The Stargaze website integrates [Squid Router](https://www.squidrouter.com/) (powered by [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)) for swaps between Ethereum, L2s, and other EVM chains.

1. Click ETH -> STARS in the wallet dropdown.
2. Click "Connect Wallet" inside the swap widget and connect Metamask. Your Ethereum address or ENS name should be shown as the sender, and your stars address should be shown for the recipient.
3. Select the amount of ETH you want to swap and click "Connect EVM Wallet".
4. Click "Review" and "Proceed" to start the transaction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bridging can take up to 15 minutes due to Ethereum finality. This delay will go away very soon with Squid Boost.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
While Metamask is usable for Stargaze, we recommend a Cosmos native wallet like [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) for the best Stargaze experience.
