  NFTs.

# Coming from Ethereum?

{% hint style="info" %}
**TLDR**

0\. Go to [http://stargaze.zone](https://t.co/Ey0UrFjCvw) and connect Metamask&#x20;

1\. Click Swap ETH -> STARS&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The main Stargaze website, stargaze.zone, supports Metamask via Snaps. Snaps enables Metamask to communicate with a non-EVM chain like Stargaze.

1. Click "Connect Wallet" and select Metamask.
2. A stars address will generated and displayed in the wallet.

That's it!

### Fund Wallet with STARS

The Stargaze website integrates [Squid Router](https://www.squidrouter.com/) (powered by [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)) for swaps between Ethereum, L2s, and other EVM chains.

1. Click ETH -> STARS in the wallet dropdown.
2. Click "Connect Wallet" inside the swap widget and connect Metamask, if it's not already connected. Your stars address should be shown for the recipient address.
3. Select the amount of ETH you want to swap and click "Connect EVM Wallet".
4. Click "Review" and "Proceed" to start the transaction.

Bridging can take up to 15 minutes due to Ethereum finality. This delay will go away very soon with Squid Boost.
