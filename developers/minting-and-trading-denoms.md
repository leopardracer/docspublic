# Minting and Trading Denoms

Stargaze provides a platform with multiple minting and trading denoms. \
So far, a project can decide to mint with STARS, USDC, ATOM, and others.\
With the Marketplace v2 upgrade, creators are able to choose a trading token different than STARS as well.\
\
To have a token utilized and integrated with Stargaze (Stargaze Website and Studio), these are the requirements:



**Add as a Launchpad minting token:**



* The token must be liquid on Osmosis (20k USD + in liquidity)
* The minting fee will be 10% for new tokens.
* Have a collection interested in minting under this new denom.

\
**Add as a Marketplace trading token:**\


* Have token liquidity on Osmosis paired with STARS
* The token liquidity must be equivalent to $25k+\*. 12.5k USD in the token wanted and 12.5k USD value in STARS.
* Have the token listed on **Coingecko** for integration purposes. This is obligatory.
* Have a collection interested in trading under this new denom.\
  \


**Apply for listing:**&#x20;

Submit your request after the requirements above are met through Stargaze Discord.

Once approved, the token will be available for minting and trading on Stargaze. The time to make it available will depend heavily on the current workload of the team, so please be patient.
