# Minting and Trading Denoms

Stargaze provides a platform with multiple minting and trading denoms. \
So far, a project can decide to mint with STARS, USDC, USK, ATOM, and others.\
With the Marketplace v2 upgrade, creators will be able to choose a trading token different than STARS as well.\
\
To have a token utilized and integrated with Stargaze (Stargaze Website and Studio), there are a few requirements:\
\
\- Have token liquidity on StarDEX paired with STARS\
\- The token liquidity must be equivalent to $25k+\*. 12.5k USD in the token wanted and 12.5k USD value in STARS.\
\- Have a collection interested in minting or trading under this new denom.\
\
**Apply for listing:**&#x20;

Submit your request after the requirements above are met through Stargaze Discord.

Once approved, the token will be available for minting and trading on Stargaze.
