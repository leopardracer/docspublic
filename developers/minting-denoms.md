# Minting Denoms

Stargaze provides a platform with multiple minting denoms. \
So far, a project can decide to mint with STARS, USDC, USK, KUJI, and others.\
\
To have a mint at a different Token than what Studio provides, there are a few requirements:\
\
\- Have token liquidity on a DEX paired with either STARS or USDC\
\- While we do not have a native DEX on Stargaze, we recommend using Osmosis.\
\- The token liquidity must be equivalent to $50k+. 25k USD in the token wanted and 25k USD value in STARS or USDC.\
\- Have a collection interested in minting under this new denom.\
\
Submit your request after the requirements above are met through Stargaze Discord.
