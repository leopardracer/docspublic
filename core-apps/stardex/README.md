# StarDEX

StarDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables native token trading on Stargaze blockchain. With an intuitive interface and support for various token pairs, Stardex provides a streamlined experience for token swaps and liquidity provisioning.&#x20;

An integration with [**pampit.fun**](https://pampit.fun/) allows "graduated" tokens (tokens that have successfully reached a certain milestone on pampit.fun) to have liquidity pools created directly on StarDEX, offering users an easy and straightforward way to trade.
