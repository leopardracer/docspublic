# Providing Liquidity

**Pools Section**

1. **Navigate to the "Pools" tab** to view all available liquidity pools on Stardex.
2. See key metrics such as **Total Liquidity**, **24h Volume**, and **STARS Price**.

**Creating or Adding Liquidity**

3. **Creating a New Pool**: To create a new liquidity pool, click **“Create Pool”**:
   * Choose between an **XYK** (Constant Product) or **Concentrated** pool type.
   * **XYK Pools** use the formula **x \* y = k**, suitable for uncorrelated tokens.
   * **Concentrated Pools** allow specifying a price range, providing higher capital efficiency.
4. **Select Tokens**: Choose the token pair and input the amounts to provide liquidity.
5. **Submit and Confirm**: Finalize by clicking **“Select Tokens”** and confirming in your wallet.

* If the token wanted is not showing on registered tokens to select from, please contact Stargaze Team by opening a ticket on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze).

**Adding Liquidity to an Existing Pool**

1. **Choose an Existing Pool** from the list and click to view details.
2. Enter the amount of tokens to add and confirm the transaction.

**Tracking Personal Positions**

* After adding liquidity, you can track your contributions and rewards within the **Pools** section.
* **The rewards are given through LP tokens**, which will be added to your current LP tokens. You may remove LP tokens from the pool at any time, converting back to both tokens.
