# Tokenomics

The distribution of STARS is designed to front-load inflation in order to bootstrap the network. This is a similar issuance schedule to Bitcoin. However, instead of halvings, issuance is cut by 1/3 each year (by multiplying the current issuance by a reduction factor of 2/3). Osmosis was the first protocol to use a [“thirding” token release schedule](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) and heavily inspired Stargaze’s design.
