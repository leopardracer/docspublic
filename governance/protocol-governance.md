# Stargaze Governance

Governance is a key part of a community-owned blockchain like Stargaze. Governance is generally performed via on-chain proposals and token-weighted voting. Based on proposal outcomes, the blockchain performs automated actions.

Because blockchain operations are typically non-reversible, proposals should be first discussed before being submitted as an on-chain proposal. Proposals submitted to the chain should be well-written, comprehensive, and leave no room for ambiguity or misinterpretation.

On-chain proposals must follow the following process:

1. Gauge community support for your proposal by bringing it up on Stargaze’s social media such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stargazezone), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stargaze).
2. Create a signaling proposal on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/). This is where you can fine-tune the parameters and specific asks for your proposal. A signaling proposal should be posted on Commonwealth _**at least 3 days before**_ an on-chain proposal. Software upgrades and contract uploads by the core team do not need to be posted to Commonwealth first.
3. Create an on-chain proposal with very clear, specific, and actionable items. At this point, all issues have been flushed out in the previous two steps. This is considered the definitive version of a proposal and results in an on-chain action upon passing.

Governance proposals that don’t go through these steps will get a de-facto **No With Veto** vote by the Foundation and core team.
