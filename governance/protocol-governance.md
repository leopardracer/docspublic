# Stargaze Governance

Governance is a key part of a community-owned blockchain like Stargaze. Governance is generally performed via on-chain proposals and token-weighted voting. Based on proposal outcomes, the blockchain performs automated actions.

Because blockchain operations are typically non-reversible, proposals should be first discussed before being submitted as an on-chain proposal. Proposals submitted to the chain should be well-written, comprehensive, and leave no room for ambiguity or misinterpretation.

On-chain proposals must follow the following process:

1. Gauge community support for your proposal by bringing it up on Stargaze’s social media such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stargazezone), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stargaze).
2. Write a post on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/). This is where you can fine-tune the parameters and specific asks for your proposal. Software upgrades and contract uploads by the core team do not need to be posted to Commonwealth first.
3. For smart contract uploads, contact the Core Team for a review and audit of your code.
4. Create an on-chain proposal with very clear, specific, and actionable items. At this point, all issues have been flushed out in the previous steps. This is considered the definitive version of a proposal and results in an on-chain action upon passing.

Proposals that don’t go through these steps are generally not viewed favorably by the validator community or token holders. Proposals that are created on-chain without any kind of prior discussion will get a de-facto **No With Veto** vote by the Foundation.
