# 7. Query contract

You can query the current state of your contract to verify if everything worked. The easiest way to do this is via the REPL.

If you have properly set your minter contract address in the config file, you can load and query it from the REPL using:

```
yarn query
```

The console will display config settings for `minter` and derive `sg721, whitelist` contracts from `minter` contract.
