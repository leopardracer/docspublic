# Discovering Stargaze

### Launchpad&#x20;

Featured and non-featured projects that launch a collection are shown on the Launchpad.

The Featured collections get a spotlight for one week, after which new collections are populated through Community Vote and Team pick.\
If you are looking to mint an NFT, the launchpad is the place to do so.

### Marketplace

This is where the secondary sales take place, after the mint happens.

Royalties are on-chain: featured projects have a 7% cap for royalties, non-featured are free to choose.&#x20;

At a collection page, you can filter by traits, rarity, price. You can also sweep the floor, make a collection offer (for 1 NFT), or make an offer for a specific NFT.&#x20;

### Auctions

Create a time-based auction for your NFT, with a reserve price (minimum winner bid).\
There is an anti-sniper cooldown (the auction extends another 15 mins if the bid is placed within the last 15 mins.)

### Names

Stargaze Names are fully integrated on the website and can be used on other apps such as Leap Wallet. Stargaze Names are NFTs themselves, mintable on-chain.&#x20;

You can [read more about Names here](https://mirror.xyz/stargazezone.eth/FnFerE5-97VBOoVAN\_-2cU2koIUDMErcPd0cGR3pPio).

### DAOs

You can participate on Stargaze DAO by staking and voting on proposals. A prior discussion on Governance takes place on Commonwealth to gauge interest from the Community.
