# Why Stargaze?

* **The Creators** - The community has been growing rapidly and the caliber of artists are impressive. The projects on Stargaze have organically created a culture of collaboration with each other. Visit [Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze) to see some of them. Apply directly to the launchpad [here](https://stargaze-zone.typeform.com/Launchpad). Learn how to launch a collection [here](https://docs.stargaze.zone/guides/readme).
* **No-Code Collection Launch -** [Stargaze Studio](https://studio.stargaze.zone/) is available, for artists that arenâ€™t familiar with coding. With Studio, you can launch simply by filling in the information needed and uploading your art/metadata.
* **Zero Gas** - Fees to transact on the Stargaze blockchain are zero.
* **Community Vote -** One project each week is decided through voting by the community. The process is outlined [here](https://www.notion.so/16a66527cad04e92bf722cf167093049?pvs=21).
* **Community Owned** - The chain is owned and secured by the community. At launch, 25% went towards the airdrop ([$150 USD million at the time](https://twitter.com/StargazeZone/status/1482944023778189317)).
* **Carbon Neutral** - Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus leaves a tiny carbon footprint. Through governance, Stargaze is completely [carbon neutral](https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/4108-making-stargaze-entirely-carbon-neutral-discussion).
* **Permissionless collections and community-approved contracts** -
  * Anyone can launch a collection at any time on Stargaze, there is no need for approval for the launch, as Stargaze is a permissionless chain.
  * The contracts used for launching collections are already on-chain, making it safer for all parties involved (minter and creators).
  * New contracts are community approved, they go through Governance voting, and can only be used once passed. This inhibits bad actors to deploy malicious contracts on Stargaze.
* **Fair Burn** - Stargaze as a platform does not collect any fees for itself/the team. The fees in place are set by the community through governance. Fair Burn fees: 50% goes back to the community (stakers), and 50% are burned (deflationary aspect of the chain).
* **Interoperability** - Being an IBC chain, interoperability is at the heart of Stargaze. View the other IBC chains Stargaze has established trade routes with at the [mapofzones](https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false\&period=24\&tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs\&tableOrderSort=desc\&zone=stargaze-1). Stargaze is developing the standard to transfer NFTs over IBC through ICS-721.
* **Ethereum Interoperability** via Gravity Bridge and Axelar
* **Layer 1 (L1) chain** - unlike other NFT marketplaces that use an existing chain, Stargaze is its own chain, with its own token ($STARS). That means Stargaze does not depend on another chain to exist and can be customized to the needs of the community.
* **Shuffled Minting** - a novel solution was made by Stargaze team to implement the non-sequential minting on a decentralized chain, providing a better UX and avoiding sniping for rare NFTs.
